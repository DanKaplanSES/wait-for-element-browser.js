# wait-for-element-browser.js

I forked and modified [wait-for-element.js](https://github.com/azu/wait-for-element.js/), reducing it down to its barebones logic, and removing any module system code. I've done this so the js files can be sourced within `head script` elements. 

It is meant for personal use, but it may help others.
